# ecommerc-dataset
# 1. Introduction

## Problem Statement: 
### The goal of this analysis is to identify the primary sources of profit within the provided e-commerce dataset covering one year of sales in America. We aim to answer the question: 'Where is the most profit generated?' to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, marketing focus, and strategic planning.

## Business Context: 
### Understanding profit drivers is crucial for optimising business operations, improving marketing ROI, managing inventory effectively, and ultimately increasing overall profitability.

# 2. Data Source

## Origin: 
### The data used for this analysis is the 'ecommerce-dataset' sourced from Kaggle.

## Scope: 
### It contains transaction details for one year of online purchases within America.

## Key Columns: 
### Relevant columns for this profit analysis include Profit, Product_Category, Product, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Shipping_cost, Customer_id, Gender, Device_Type, Customer_Login_Type, Order_Priority, Payment_method, and Order_Date.

## Quality & Limitations:
### - The dataset provides a snapshot of one year, so findings might not capture longer-term trends or seasonality beyond that period.
### - Geographic scope is limited to 'America' (the specifics of which region 'America' refers to - US, North America, etc. - might be a limitation if not clearly defined in the metadata).
### - Data quality needs assessment. Initial checks has been performed for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies (e.g., negative profit, unreasonable discounts) which could impact the analysis.
### - The granularity of Product might be very high, potentially requiring aggregation to the Product_Category level for clearer insights.

# 3. Methodology

## Tools: 
### The analysis was conducted using Python with Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualisation.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation:
### - Initial steps involved loading the dataset and assessing its structure and data types.
### - Handled missing values in key columns (e.g., Profit, Product_Category). Depending on the extent and nature of missing data, strategies like imputation (mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical) or row removal were considered/applied [State what you did, if applicable, or what you would do].
### - Checked for and addressed potential outliers, particularly in Profit, Sales, and Discount columns, to prevent skewing results [Explain method if used, e.g., using IQR method or capping at a certain percentile].
### - Ensured data types were appropriate (e.g., Order_Date as datetime objects, numerical columns as floats/integers).
### - Feature Engineering: Extracted new features such as 'Month' or 'Quarter' from Order_Date to analyse time trends, and calculating 'Profit Margin'.

## Analysis Techniques:
### - Descriptive Statistics: Calculated overall total profit and average profit per order.
###  - Aggregation & Segmentation: Grouped the data by various dimensions (Product_Category, Product, Device_Type, Customer_Login_Type, Gender, Order_Priority, Payment_method) and calculated the sum and/or average Profit for each segment.
### - Time Series Analysis: Aggregated profit by month or quarter (derived from Order_Date) to identify any temporal patterns or seasonality in profitability.
### - Correlation Analysis: Investigated relationships between Profit and other numerical variables like Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Shipping_cost to understand factors influencing profitability.

# 4. Findings

## Overall Profit: 
### The total profit generated over the year was $[Total Profit Amount].

## Profit by Product Category:
### - (Use a Bar Chart) Display total profit per Product_Category, sorted from highest to lowest.
### - The analysis reveals that the most significant portion of profit comes from [List top 2-3 categories]. Conversely, [List bottom 1-2 categories] contribute the least profit, or potentially generate losses.

## Profit by Other Dimensions (Use clear visuals like bar charts, potentially tables for top N):
### - Device Type: Comparing Device_Type, we found that purchases made via [Web/Mobile] generate [higher/lower/similar] total profit." (Show bar chart).

### - Customer Type: Analysis of Customer_Login_Type shows that [Members/Guests] contribute significantly [more/less] to overall profit. (Show bar chart).

### - Profitability Drivers: (Use Scatter Plots or Bar Charts)
#### - There is a [strong/weak/positive/negative] relationship between Sales and Profit. While higher sales often lead to higher profit, this isn't always the case, potentially due to factors like discounts or shipping costs. (Show scatter plot: Profit vs Sales).
#### - The Discount rate significantly impacts profitability. Higher discounts correlate with [lower profit/losses] in several product categories. (Show scatter plot: Profit vs Discount, maybe colored by category).

## Profit Over Time: (Use a Line Chart)
### - Profitability shows [mention trend: e.g., peaks during Q4, dips in summer, is relatively stable] over the year. (Show line chart: Profit vs Month/Quarter).

## High-Profit Products: Within the top categories, specific products like [Product A, Product B] stand out as major profit contributors.(Maybe a table or focused bar chart if data allows).

# 5. Recommendations

## - Focus on High-Profit Areas: Allocate marketing budget and inventory investment towards the top profit-generating Product_Category ([List them again]). Explore opportunities for cross-selling or up-selling within these categories.

## - Address Low-Profit Areas: Investigate the low profitability of [List bottom categories/products]. Analyse their cost structure, pricing strategy, and discount levels. Consider strategic repricing, cost reduction, or even SKU rationalization (discontinuation) if they consistently generate losses.

## - Optimise Channel Strategy: Given the profitability associated with [Web/Mobile] users, ensure a seamless user experience on this platform. If one channel lags, investigate potential friction points.

## - Leverage Customer Type: Since [Members/Guests] are more profitable, develop strategies to encourage sign-ups or enhance loyalty programs to increase member engagement and retention.

## - Review Discount Policy: Re-evaluate the discounting strategy, particularly for categories where high discounts significantly erode profit margins. Implement smarter, targeted promotions instead of broad, deep discounts.

## - Manage Seasonality: Plan promotional activities and inventory levels according to the observed seasonal profit trends ([mention peak/low periods]) to maximize returns during peak times and mitigate losses during off-peak periods.

# 6. Conclusion

## - In conclusion, this analysis pinpointed where the most profit is found within the business's e-commerce operations over the past year. The primary drivers are clearly [mention top product categories] and potentially influenced by [mention key factor like customer type or device].

## - By focusing resources on the most profitable segments, addressing areas of low profitability, and refining strategies around customer types, channels, and promotions, the business can make data-driven decisions to enhance overall profitability.

## - These insights provide a clear roadmap for strategic adjustments aimed at boosting the bottom line.
